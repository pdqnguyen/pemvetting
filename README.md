This code performs environmental checks for GW event candidates using PEM coupling functions and time-frequency signal overlaps.

See http://pem.ligo.org/couplingfunctions/ for current PEM coupling function data and documentation.

More information on the PEM subsystem can be found at http://pem.ligo.org/channelinfo/.
